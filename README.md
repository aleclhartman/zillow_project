# Zillow Linear Regression Project

## Purpose
This repository holds all resources used in the attainment of the goals established for the Zillow Linear Regresssion Project.

## Goals
1. Develop a model to predict home values using square feet, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Do this for each feature first then in combination.
2. Create a summary presentation about the drivers of single unit property values
3. Plot distributions of tax rates for each county, and provide key measures of central tendency and measures of spread.

## Hypothesis

Single unit property value is independent of square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms

## Instructions for Cloning

## Possible Variable Interactions
- The number of bathrooms may be dependent on the number of bedrooms
- The number of bathrooms and bedrooms may both be dependent on square footage

## Need to Haves
1. Linear model predicting home values using square feet, bedrooms, and bathrooms
2. Report of drivers of single unit property values

## Nice to Haves
1. Data dictionary
2. At least 1 t-test and 1 correlation test
3. Plot variable pairs
4. Scaling
5. Feature engineering
6. Writing zillow_data.csv from query
7. Writing california_fips.csv from clipboard
